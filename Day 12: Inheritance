Objective
Today, we're delving into Inheritance. Check out the attached tutorial for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:
A Student class constructor, which has parameters:

A string, firstname
A string, lastname
An integer,interger
An integer array (or vector) of test scores,


A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:


CODE

class Person:
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
		self.idNumber = idNumber
	def printPerson(self):
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)

class Student(Person):
    #   Class Constructor
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber, score):
            Person.__init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber)
            self.scores = score

    def calculate(self):
            res = sum(self.scores) / len(self.scores)
            if res >= 90:
                    return 'O'
            elif res >= 80:
                    return "E"
            elif res >= 70:
                    return "A"
            elif res >= 55:
                    return "P"
            elif res >= 40:
                    return "D"
            else:
                    return "T"
            


line = input().split()
firstName = line[0]
lastName = line[1]
idNum = line[2]
numScores = int(input()) # not needed for Python
scores = list( map(int, input().split()) )
s = Student(firstName, lastName, idNum, scores)
s.printPerson()
print("Grade:", s.calculate())
